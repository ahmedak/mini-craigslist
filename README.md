mini-craigslist
===============

cs207 mini project repository

## We started using git only after initial versions of some files were made, so don't expect to see all the initial changes.

This is mini-craigslist, which is a mini-project for CS207 course at IIT Mandi.

Objectives:
1- Be able to post and search for classifieds (yeah, mini version)
2- Implement user login system 
3- Implement using relational database management system

We have used PHP and Mysql for this project.
This README may be updated according to requirements.
